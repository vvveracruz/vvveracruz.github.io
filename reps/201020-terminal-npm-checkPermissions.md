Problem:
```
npm WARN checkPermissions Missing write access to /usr/local/lib/node_modules

```

Solution:
- check who owns the directory `ls -la /usr/local/lib/node_modules`
- in my case this was `root`
- double check what your user is `whoami`
- change owner to yourself `sudo chown -R veracruz: /usr/local/lib/node_modules`

- physical quantities have been historically defined according to the way in which we recognise them when confronted by them in observations of the world
- to find physical quantities we perform operations, then calculations
- operations are things like experiments and observations (depending on the level of control we have over all variables)
- clculations yield __manufactured quantities__ which (ideally) help us form a picture of the world
  - ie by measuring a distance x we are measuring something already existing in the world
- but there are certainly measurements we make that we would not consider a 'part of the world' e.g. [parallax][1]
- when we measure parallax we implicitly understand this is not an implicit distinct elemtn int the true picture of nature -- it is a direct result of the way in which we are observing a distant object.
- we would say we 'measure' lengths whereas we 'manufacture' Parallax
- however when we stop to think about it (and that is the purpose of this post) we realise there is no real reason to make this distinction -- we only do so because we have inherited a preconceived theory of the world in which this distinction is implicitly made
- distance and parallax have the same kind of __potential existence__ even before they are measured:
  - if you move sideways you can determine the angular shift, if you lay measuring rods in a line you can count their number
- this potential existence – whatever it is in actuality – is not created in the act of measurement
- this tells us something about the __world-condition__, that is some existing condition or relation in the external world
- we don't seem to have a reason to think that this world condition resembles distance any more than parallax (outside of historic and cultural influences -- look up how different cultures understand 'distance' and other measures, look into language used to describe space in different disconnected cultures)
- any notion of "resemblance between physical quantities and the world-conditions underlying them seems inappropriate"
- for example consider a hypothetical set of measurements such that both this relationship

$$ AB = 2BC $$

where \\(AB\\) is the distance from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), and similarly for \\(BC\\).

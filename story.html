    <p>Jacob was getting tired of poking at the wall trying to get the black wall paper to lift when he felt a rush of wind coming through the house. The scent of lavender, hay and sweat came after that, and then the sound of keys falling onto more keys, in the bamboo bowl by the door that had been heated up to a comfortable temperature by the soft sun characteristic of places this far from the Equator. The light had that magic, fairy dust quality that seems to only exist in memories of childhood, like it knows it is life giving, but this was only available to Jacob, since the other person in the room, before his mother had arrived, was his grandfather Jonas Akk, for whom childhood memories where distant in time, but only in time.</p>
    <p>Mr. Akk was born so long ago it was hard for Jacob to understand how much life there had been before his own. That is the case for all children, but especially for Jacob, not least because he hadn't given the matter much thought but also because it is a horror reserved for those of us that survive childhood to come to understand a consciousness outside one's own. Mr. Akk, however, was keen on telling stories, and there is nothing more human than listening to a foreign explanation of ourselves.</p>
    <p>Mr. Akk had been mulling over tonight's story for a while. It was both his curse, and his greatest gift to have had a daughter such as he did, one that tolerated, and at times even enjoyed having him in close proximity. It gave him the chance to mould young Jacob's mind. Not a week ago, for example, he had managed to convince his grandson that through the power of his mind alone he could change the most elemental fabric of reality. All it had taken was one cunning story involving magic, training of the mind and a charming young fellow with fiery hair and a love of music. Those sorts of stories were his favourite, of course. He knew he'd eventually need to move on to something a bit more real, he'd need to introduce unhappy endings and ties forever loose or his grandson would soon bore of him, but for now he could bask in the ever glowing light of bigger men than him.</p>

    <p>Tonight's story held a special place in Mr. Akk's heart because he got to remember that once, not so long ago, he too had been a greater man.</p>
    <p>"Once, not so long ago, your own grandpa was a young man. And as a young man he did what youth required of him: he struggled, he learnt and he searched for something greater than him that he could give himself to. As it happened, there was a great adventure in search of him, too, and as God in heaven had prescribed, two things which search for each other have but one resting place. But I lose myself -- it wasn't long until he came up against the League of Exploration.
    Now one does not simply come upon greatness -- and I hope you remember this Jacob --, one can have greatness thrust in its face with not so much as an ounce changing in them, but young Jonas knew greatness was in his destiny, for an old mage had told him so–"</p>
    <p>"That seems unlikely," Jacob interrupted.</p>
    <p>"Alright, alright... Now, young Jonas knew greatness was in his destiny, for he had the gift of new naïvety, a taste for the dramatic, and, if he was honest with himself, a bucketful of arrogance that he would never be rid of. It was just as well, though, because when Greatness so much as glanced in his direction he was well and ready for the ride.
    So it was this how Jonas Akk, a most notable no one, ended up on the Silverstein ship.</p>
    <p>The third best thing about the ship was, without a doubt, the crew. Three months of training had brought the group into a sweet spot between camaraderie and not knowing each other well enough to tell the truth, whilst the somewhat uncertain prospect of death among the Stars made sure they all kept their jokes surface level, and didn't get too attached to each other.

    <p>“The second…”</p>

# VGG.CZ

This is the repo for my personal website. It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The maths is rendered by kramdown (default with Jekyll) using the [Mathjax library](https://www.mathjax.org/) by simply including `_includes/mathjax.html` in the header of the relevant layouts. I used [bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) for the base stylesheets, specifically [this example template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/blog/).

To run locally
- navigate to root directory
- run `bundle install` to install all gems
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- navigate to `localhost:4000`.

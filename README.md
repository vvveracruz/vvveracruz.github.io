# VGG.CZ

This is the repo for my personal website. It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The maths is rendered by kramdown (default with Jekyll) using the [Mathjax library](https://www.mathjax.org/) by simply including `_includes/mathjax.html` in the header of the relevant layouts.

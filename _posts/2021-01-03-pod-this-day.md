> Jody Avirgan, political historian Nicole Hemmer, and special guests rescue moments from the entirety of U.S. history to map our journey through a tumultuous year. Each episode takes on one moment from that day and explores what makes it interesting, and what lessons can be learned –– all in under ten minutes.

From their website, [thisdaypod.com][1].

Jody and Nicole have an easy going approach to talking about history. It's a bit like sitting round a campfire telling ghost stories, except the ghosts are those of elections past, and the campfire, well.

Recently they have been releasing a second weekly episode, a more free-form (and longer) version of their discussions about moments in US election history, but it's usually not all just about presidents. They have covered all sorts of intricate snippets of US history that I do not have the mental hooks to remember.

Politics-wise, I find their interpretations tend to lean further left than I do. They do an extraordinarily good job of presenting the facts in an unpartisan, unbiased way though, which is refreshing considering the state of American political discourse.

They do a very good job of giving nuanced accounts of the events they cover but I can't help but feel that they are overly constrained by this time limit. It is possible these are aired on an actual radio station (what is this the 90s?) so this time limit might be out of their control.  

From what I can tell, this podcast is available on all major streaming platforms, but I like to use [Pocketcasts][2]. Mainly so I can skip the last two minutes. I'm not sure what they talk about there but it's certainly not esoteric political history.

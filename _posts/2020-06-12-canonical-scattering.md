My third year undergraduate project was on solving canonical scattering problems using Bessel Equations and modelling this behaviour using python. A quick overview of what this entailed can be seen in the slides below. [The full report is available here.](assets/pdf-slides.pdf) Both of these (and the somewhat messy Python code) are available in the repo, too.

##### I'm _so_ close to finishing the Python course I'm taking on Udemy
- I'd used Python before (in a very hacky way) but I'm feeling really comfortable with it now.
- The repo for this is [here][5], [this link][1] will take you to the course on Udemy.

##### Jupyter notebooks
- I discovered you can export Jupyter Notebooks as markdown files and I couldn't resist.
- I uploaded three notebooks I'd been working on for the course to the site.
- A bit cringe, but I'm leaving it up for posterity.
- I think it'll be cool to look back on them.
- If you're really interested... [1][2],  [2][3], [3][4].

##### I reached my reading goal for the year on Goodreads...
- ...and I feel pretty meh about it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Some highlights:
  - [This book about the history of written language][6],
  - [This book about Genesis One][7], and
  - [This pop-science style metaphysics book][8].

##### I've been taking a course on React
- This is also the first time I've ever written my own Javascript üôà
- I'm really enjoying the modularity React offers, it works really well with the way I think about problems.
- I'm building a site for [Filmmakers Without Cameras][9] with React, I posted a little sneakpeak of this on Twitter.
- I'm loving pure css animations! There might be a little tutorial coming...

##### I listen to a lot of podcasts
- This isn't new, but there's a few I've been listening to a lot this past month.
- I've been listening to the archive of episodes of the [1Password podcast][10].
- [This Day in Esoteric Political History][11] is pretty cool as well.

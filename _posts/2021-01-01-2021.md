I'm foreseeing a lot of time at home in 2021, so I thought I'd give myself a challenge and try some new things.

Well, new to me. Full disclosure, this whole thing was inspired by [Matt D'Avella][1]. I'm going to be trying a new habit, or 'challenge' every month.

This January, I'll be writing every day.

Obligatory disclaimer: it's not going to be good. I've spent most of today already trying to put some thoughts together. It's not that I don't have ideas, but that none of them are fleshed out enough for me to feel confident enough to bring them forth into the world yet. I guess they aren't ever really going to be, and that's the point. I'd like to assume I'm wrong, and put it on the internet anyway. For fun.

I'll update this list every day, as I publish more things. For today though, I'm counting this one as a win. It's very interesting to see how much I've struggled even writing this little introduction. It just reinforces for me that I need to do this. Clearly I'm scared of it. Time to fight the dragon, or like, something less Jordan Peterson-esque if you like.

Catch you tomorrow, blog.

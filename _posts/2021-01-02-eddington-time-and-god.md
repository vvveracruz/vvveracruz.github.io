Prior to Einstein there was no doubt that there existed a true even-flowing time which was unique and universal.

At present, there is no test which will distinguish the true time from the fictitious, so there is no reason to posit the existence of this true, even-flowing time. Or in the words of [Eddington][1]:

> The off chance that a future generation may discover a significance in our utterances is scarcely an excuse for making meaningless noises [...] There is no way of progress here.

At present, we have no way of objectively distinguishing `God` from `no God`. This isn't an argument against God's existence. It is good reason be skeptic of explanations relying on the existence of God.

How would we distinguish a miracle from being an act of God, to it being not an act of God?

Say my pet dies, and I pray to God to bring it back to life. God answers, and my pet wakes up. (It has only been a few hours so this is not a zombie-pet scenario). What would we see if we had the pet hooked up to some monitors, say to measure the heartbeat, brain activity. Wouldn't we see the heart starting again? Wouldn't we start seeing electrical activity come back to the brain?

In what way can we say God did this? **Even if he did.**

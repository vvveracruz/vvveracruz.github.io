Here's some disconnected thoughts on something John Maynard Keynes said a long time ago.

Keynes puts forward this thought experiment in his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money:

Say contestants are given a hundred photographs of women, and they have to choose six beautiful women from out of those. The winner is not the contestant which successfully chooses the six most beautiful women, but that contestant who's selection comes closest to the most popular combination.

Personally I think this works much better with cute cats, but it could just be the spirit of the age talking.

Now crucially we also assign a cuteness-level measure to each cat, based on the number of contestants that rate each cat among their top six.

As an aside, I always find it is cool how in Ye Olden Days authors would feel secure enough to give their treatises such pompous names as _**The** General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money_. It's interesting how this has shifted with time.

With a system that relies on the participant's ability to predict the average competitor's expected average opinion, do we think this would yield pictures of the six cutest cats?

We tie so much to this measure-number, the stock price, but it doesn't seem at all clear that it corresponds to a world-condition at all.

What if there is nothing to be measured?
